# Data Circuit

Premium sci-fi hover racing UI foundation built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and lucide-react. The current milestone focuses on the design system and motion language; gameplay for `/race/1` will be added next.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to view the landing page and the Style Playground.

## Next steps

- Implement the `/race/1` gameplay experience using the established design system and motion primitives.
- Extend the telemetry HUD with live data streams and controls.
- Add bilingual language toggle leveraging the prepared font stack.
